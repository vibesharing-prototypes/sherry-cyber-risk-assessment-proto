    rationale: `Threat — Ransomware attack (severity: High): Ransomware operators actively target internet-facing payment infrastructure. The High rating reflects documented toolkits and initial-access brokers selling footholds in financial-services networks.

Vulnerability — Unpatched web server (severity: Very high): Missing patches on the web tier provide a well-documented entry point. Exploitation is often automated and scannable, making the window between disclosure and compromise short.

Asset — Payment gateway (criticality: Very high): The payment gateway processes all customer transactions. Encryption or disruption of this system halts revenue collection and erodes customer trust immediately.

Likelihood determination: High threat combined with Very high vulnerability produces a High likelihood — attackers have both motive and a straightforward exploitation path.

Impact determination: Very high asset criticality means any successful ransomware event directly interrupts revenue and triggers regulatory reporting.

Risk calculation: The resulting High cyber risk score warrants priority remediation: accelerate patching cadence for the web tier, harden network paths to the gateway, and validate immutable backups for payment data.`,

    rationale: `Threat — Ransomware attack (severity: High): Ransomware against customer data stores is a High-severity threat given common double-extortion tactics and the speed at which operators move laterally after first access.

Vulnerability — Lack of network segmentation (severity: Very high): Flat network architecture allows an attacker who gains any foothold to reach the customer database without additional barriers, making lateral movement trivial.

Asset — Customer database (criticality: Very high): The customer database holds regulated personal data. Encryption or exfiltration triggers mandatory breach notification and significant financial exposure.

Likelihood determination: High threat paired with Very high vulnerability produces High likelihood — once inside the network, the path to the database is unobstructed.

Impact determination: Very high criticality ensures any successful attack has severe customer, legal, and financial consequences.

Risk calculation: High cyber risk score. Remediation should prioritize network segmentation, micro-segmentation around the database tier, privilege access management, and tested offline backups.`,

    rationale: `Threat — Phishing campaign (severity: Medium): Broad phishing campaigns are a common initial access vector. The Medium rating reflects that execution still depends on user interaction and the campaign is not narrowly targeted.

Vulnerability — Insufficient employee security training (severity: High): Gaps in security awareness training leave employees susceptible to credential harvesting and malicious attachments, increasing the odds of successful initial compromise.

Asset — Email server (criticality: High): The email server is a central communications hub. Compromise grants access to sensitive correspondence, internal credentials, and potential pivot points into other systems.

Likelihood determination: Medium threat combined with High vulnerability produces Medium likelihood — phishing is frequent but requires the human element to succeed.

Impact determination: High asset criticality means a compromised email server exposes confidential communications and can serve as a launchpad for further attacks.

Risk calculation: Low cyber risk score reflects moderate likelihood against a high-value target. Prioritize phishing simulations, mandatory security awareness training, and phishing-resistant MFA for mail access.`,

    rationale: `Threat — Phishing campaign (severity: High): Targeted phishing against social media operators is High severity because compromised brand accounts can be weaponized to distribute malware or fraudulent content to followers.

Vulnerability — Insufficient employee security training (severity: High): Marketing and social media staff without adequate training are prime targets for credential harvesting through impersonation of platform support or partner accounts.

Asset — Social media accounts (criticality: Medium): Social media accounts have Medium criticality — compromise damages brand reputation and may spread disinformation, but does not directly expose regulated data.

Likelihood determination: High threat paired with High vulnerability produces High likelihood — social media credentials are actively targeted and training gaps make success probable.

Impact determination: Medium criticality limits the blast radius to reputational damage and potential follower exposure rather than direct data breach.

Risk calculation: Low cyber risk score despite High likelihood, constrained by the Medium impact ceiling. Enforce MFA on all social accounts, establish a takeover response playbook, and include social engineering scenarios in training.`,

    rationale: `Threat — DDoS attack (severity: Very high): DDoS attacks against payment infrastructure are Very high severity due to commoditized botnets and the direct revenue impact of even brief outages.

Vulnerability — Open network ports (severity: High): Unnecessary open ports increase the attack surface and amplification potential. High severity reflects that the exposure is detectable and exploitable without sophisticated tooling.

Asset — Payment gateway (criticality: Very high): Downtime on the payment gateway halts all transaction processing, causing immediate revenue loss and SLA violations with merchant partners.

Likelihood determination: Very high threat combined with High vulnerability produces High likelihood — DDoS-for-hire services make attacks affordable and repeatable.

Impact determination: Very high criticality ensures any sustained outage has severe business and contractual consequences.

Vulnerability — Missing intrusion detection system (severity: Medium): Without IDS, anomalous traffic patterns go undetected until service degradation is reported by users, delaying response and increasing blast radius.

Asset — DNS server (criticality: Very high): The DNS server is foundational infrastructure. Loss of name resolution renders all dependent services unreachable regardless of their individual health.

Likelihood determination: High threat with Medium vulnerability yields Medium likelihood — the attack vector is viable but partial compensating controls exist.

Impact determination: Very high criticality because DNS failure cascades across the entire service portfolio.

    rationale: `Threat — Insider data exfiltration (severity: High): Privileged insiders with database access represent a High threat because they already possess legitimate credentials and knowledge of where sensitive data resides.

Vulnerability — Missing data encryption at rest (severity: High): Unencrypted data at rest means a malicious insider can copy raw data files or backups without triggering decryption-layer controls or key audit events.

Asset — Customer database (criticality: Very high): The customer database holds regulated personal information. Bulk exfiltration triggers mandatory breach notification and significant legal exposure.

Likelihood determination: High threat combined with High vulnerability produces High likelihood — the insider already has access and no encryption barrier stands in the way.

Vulnerability — Missing data loss prevention controls (severity: High): Without DLP, large data exports via queries, API calls, or direct file copies go undetected, providing a clear exfiltration path.

Asset — Data warehouse (criticality: High): The data warehouse aggregates business intelligence including financial metrics, operational KPIs, and derived customer insights. Exposure is damaging but less directly regulated than raw customer PII.

Likelihood determination: Medium threat with High vulnerability yields Medium likelihood — the path exists but the threat actor pool is constrained.
